 Here is my(ql459) review for Vaidehi Vidhyadhar Thete, vvt221
 
 CLARITY: 
 For the first figure, it displays the median age of each puma against the median age of each corresponding citibike station. The distribution and the color of spots shows the distribution of age. And it comes with the conclusion behind the plots. 
 The second plot shows us the ratio of female to male ridership in each citibike station. It provides the find that ratio is higher in mid income areas.
 The thrid plot displays the distribution of income against the ridership in each citibike station can provide the find from the plot.

 All of plots are clear to tell and provide with corrected captions and legend. 

 ESTHETIC: For the first plot, I would suggest the color choosen for dots could be more obvious or in the opposite color. Since the color dots with larger median age is lighter than the smaller median age, it could be confused for the audience. For the second plot, the color could also be in the opposite way. The color could go darker as the numerical variables go larger.

 HONESTY: The plot is honestly reproducing the data. I went through the whole process of data wrangling and plots on my laptop.

 IMPROVMENT: Genrally those three plots are good for visuallization, but it could be better if change the color choose for plots.
