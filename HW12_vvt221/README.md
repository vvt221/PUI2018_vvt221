# PUI2018 HW 12

## Assignment 1:

* Worked independently on the HW
* Identified 5 clusters using K-means clustering algorithm
* Isolated time series clusters and plotted them independently 
* Performed hierarchical agglomerative clustering and plotted the dendogram

* Update: 
kept 245 values instead pf 230 ,didnt drop nans

## Assignment 2:

* Worked independently on the HW
* Used Fourier transform to identify the top 4 station id with high annual peroidicity.

* Extra Credit:
* Attempted to identify clusters
* Judging by the elbow plot, the clusters appear to identify station ids better than ridership types.
